## Summary

This first release introduces the Create Release Notes action. It receives a release summary, a version and an optional changelog URL and modifies the release summary to say which version was released in the header, and adds a link to the changelog at the bottom.

These are rendered both back to the original Markdown format, and as a plain text string - to be used for release notes in packages such as NuGet.
